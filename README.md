### Hi everyone, I'm Chi An Le ðŸ‘‹
I am looking to land my first job as a Data Analyst. I have a BEng degree in Mechatronics, and a MSc degree in Engineering Management, and started my career as an Automotive Software Developer at Bosch Global Software Vietnam.
I really enjoy connecting with like-minded data people, sharing my skills, experience and personal journey within the world of data.
